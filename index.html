<h1>
<center>1.1 The Arithmetic of Numbers</center>
</h1>
<h2>
<a href="https://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/part_one.html">Exercise 1</a>: Add the following definitions for x and y to DrRacketâ€™s definitions area:
<br><br>
(define x 3)
<br>
(define y 4)
<br><br>
Now imagine that x and y are the coordinates of a Cartesian point. Write down an expression that computes the distance of this point to the origin, that is, a point with the coordinates (0,0).
<br><br>
The expected result for these values is 5, but your expression should produce the correct result even after you change these definitions.
<br><br>
Just in case you have not taken geometry courses or in case you forgot the formula that you encountered there, the point (x,y) has the distance
$$\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$$
from the origin. After all, we are teaching you how to design programs, not how to be a geometer.
<br><br>
Here's the formula in Racket (BSL):
<br><br>
(sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y)))
<br><br>
And since we can use <a href="https://github.com/viebel/klipse">KLIPSE</a>, here it is in Clojure:
<pre><code class="language-klipse">
(def x 3)
(def y 4)
(Math/sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y)))
</code></pre>
Your mathematics teacher would say that you computed the distance formula. To use the formula on alternative inputs, you need to open DrRacket, edit the definitions of x and y so they represent the desired coordinates, and click RUN. But this way of reusing the distance formula is cumbersome and naive. We will soon show you a way to define functions, which makes reusing formulas straightforward. For now, we use this kind of exercise to call attention to the idea of functions and to prepare you for programming with them.
